THROUGHLINE:
We pour a batch of Python source code (.py file) into the Granulator.

Through a series of processing steps, we generate an inventory of 'grains'â€”each providing:
- lineage: where, in the original bulk material, this grain was found
- type: whether it is a TEXT description or an object IDENTITY
- substance: the found TEXT or IDENTITY itself
- location: in the original source material
- progenitor: is it the first of a new line?

Metaphorically, the Python source code is the bulk_material we work on.
It is tokenized into a powder of token particles, which are then purified and mixed into a precursor for refinement into grains.

Particles are tracked through a batch record, capturing the Pythonic scope in which each particle is found.

Particles are distilled into grains such that a sequence like:
>NAME.string='self' OP.string='.' NAME.string='powder'

becomes an IDENTITY grain with substance='self.powder'.

NOTE: I discovered that tokens flow around such that DEDENTS arise not after the last line of indentation but immediately before the first dedented line...
Subtle, upshot is in-line comments don't always turn up in the token stream as one might expect. 
To counter this I have added the 'suspension/bubble-up' concept during the fine-mix so that in-line semantics more reliably associate with the correct lineage.

FIGURATION:
Takes an unruly, heterogeneous input bulk material and turns it into an intermediate purified precursor which is then refined into grains.

Uses the SAMPLE test bed to inspect each particle and applies track&trace (via the registrar) to give just the particles of interest along with their full lineage.

Then refines particles into grains
